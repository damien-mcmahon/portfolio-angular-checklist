# Angular +Firebase Checklist Creator
This is an angular app, backed by Firebase that creates checklists that can be stored on Firebase using Facbook or email/password login.


## Todo
This is a work in progress and the following are things yet to do (brain dump, not necessarily in order):
- [x] Get a basic app scaffold sorted
- [ ] Create layout to allow instant access to list creation
- [ ] Enable login via FB or Email for saving
- [ ] Create Simple dashboard for managing Checklists
- [ ] Create a view for displaying and using saved lists
- [ ] Styling
